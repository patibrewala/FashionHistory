    "## COGS18 Final Project: Fashion History\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is python GUI to display **fashion history**. This program creates a tkinter window which displays fashion history based on user's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program can display fashion history of:\n",
    " * A decade\n",
    " * A clothing item\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the history of everything, I used multiple differnt website. Here are few of them:\n",
    " * retrowaste.com\n",
    " * vintagedancer.com\n",
    " * fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu\n",
    " I also used wikipedia a lot (I know its not good citation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program employees a GUI using 'tkinter' module to return fahion history.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by creating two function, one to store and get decade fashion history and second to get apparel history. For context, 'print_decade_info()' returns the fashion history of a particular decade. Then I created a function, 'decade_or_apparel()', to find out if user is asking for decade history or apparel history. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, The program gets the raw text input from a user then converts it to lowercase and also replaces spaces if input is a string. This allows a user to not worry about proper cases. For example, \"CroP   tOp \" will be accepted aa a valid input and history of crop tops will be printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra credit:** I have never worked with a GUI before this project. In the begining, it was really hard. Apparently macOS version 10.14 had a bug which made my system crash every time I tried to run tkinter. I was so confused about why that was happening and I was almost going to give up on GUI when I stumbled upon a stackoverflow post about this bug. I had to downgrade python to make it work. After all of this, learning differnt widgets of tkinter was fairly easy and a lot of fun.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "This program **rins properly** through this Jupyter notebook. You can also use a terminal to run my project files.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### This program requires 'tkinter' and 'pillow/ PIL'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to test the program(**year** is for decade history, **clothing items** is for their hsitory):\n",
    "\n",
    " * 2001\n",
    " * 1947\n",
    " * 1850\n",
    " * jeans\n",
    " * t-shirt\n",
    " \n",
    " **List of all clothing items whose history is available:**\n",
    " crop top, t-shirt, hoodie, bodysuit, jumpsuit, bikini, overalls, romper, jeans, leggings, palazzo pants, capris, cargo pants, sweatpants, joggers, shorts, mini skirt, maxi skirt, pencil skirt, wrapdress, bandage dress, bodycon dress, shirt dress, sun dress and little black dress(LBD). \n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about fashion!"
